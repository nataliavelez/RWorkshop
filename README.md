# RWorkshop
R Workshop for undergraduate/summer RA's, based on the Psych 252 R Tutorials

Welcome to the R workshop! In this workshop, you'll go through all of the basic steps of analyzing a dataset in R. We'll load, inspect, wrangle, visualize, summarize, and analyze real datasets. This workshop is split into two parts:

* **rworkshop2017_part1** - Crash course to R. This part includes a lot of exposition, and a few easy exercises.
* **rworkshop2017_part2** - Analyze a dataset yourself. This part is mostly composed of exercises that you will work through together.

To download this dataset, make sure you have [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) installed on your computer. Then go to your Terminal and:

* Use `cd` to navigate to the directory where you want to keep the tutorial files (e.g., `cd ~/Documents`)
* Clone the workshop into that directory by typing: `git clone https://github.com/nataliavelez/RWorkshop.git`

This workshop is currently under construction, so you'll have to update it the morning of the workshop to make sure you have the latest version of the tutorials! To sync your copy of the workshop:

* Open Terminal, and navigate to the folder containing the workshop files (e.g., `cd ~/Documents/RWorkshop`)
* Within that directory, type `git pull origin master`
